# Welcome to ng-workshop

This is a source-code which is used for angular workshop. Follow the steps instructed in the presentation to fulfill the workshop.

## Starting the project

```javascript

gulp
```


After starting the project, browser-sync will be initiated alongside with watch task, so you will not have to refresh/rebuild at any time.

npm i -g gulp
```
